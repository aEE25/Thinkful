For each of the following scenarios, call out the potential biases in the proposed experiment. Do your best to try to discover not only the bias, but the initial design. There is plenty of room for interpretation here, so make sure to state what assumptions you're making.


You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.

Assumptions - location (Northern Hemisphere) and weather trends (too cold to swim in February)
Bathing suits are more seaonal in May over February, so more people are likely to be interested/responsive in May.  People interested in bathing suits in February are likely to be wealthier (able to afford travel to warm-weather vacation spots) or young (plans for college Spring Break trips)


You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.

Assumptions - the clinic advertises a speciality of anxiety treatment
If you practice the treatment of anxiety, you are more likely attuned to identify it - you are more likely to see it in anyone you meet, in contract to the general population that is less educated on the subject and likely under-reports their anxiety.
People who believe they need treatment for anxiety are more likely to visit an anxiety treatment clinic - why go if you don't need treatment.


You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.

Assumptions - billboard ads list website
The placement of the billboards may be in communities not previously familiar with the website - increasing new visitors
Is this increased traffic from repeat visitors or new visitors?
How long do visitors spend on the website?  Do they monetize their visit (purchase, enroll - whatever is appropriate to this website)?
The language (English, Spanish, etc) might impact success based on location.


You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.

Has the loyalty program been announced/advertised?
Does the loyalty program require enrollment?  Has anyone enrolled?
Is there a charge for the program?
What is the business? Is it reasonable to expect an increase in one week?
