Look back to the potential experiments in the previous assignment. For one of those experiments, write up the essential points of a research proposal for an improved version of that experiment.

A company with work sites in five different countries has sent you data on employee satisfaction rates for workers in Human Resources and workers in Information Technology. Most HR workers are concentrated in three of the countries, while IT workers are equally distributed across worksites. The company requests a report on satisfaction for each job type. You calculate average job satisfaction for HR and for IT and present the report.

The Problem - Are employees in Human Resources and Information Techology satisfied with their jobs?

Potential Solution - Employee satisfaction in each department is influenced by location and demograchic information.

Method of Testing - 
Ask employees to rate their overall satisfaction in life and their job satisfaction.  Collect demographic information (age, gender, etc) and location as well as department.
Compare satisfaction results by location and demographic information.  Identify any trends in responses by department, location and demographic information.
The final report should identify the elements that seem to impact satisfaction rates in each department.  This may have the benefit of helping the company identify any problem areas and/or where to focus efforts to improve job satisfaction.
