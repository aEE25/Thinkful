For each of the following questions, outline how you could use an A/B test to find an answer. Be sure to identify all five key components of an A/B test.

Does a new supplement help people sleep better?
Versions - group A takes no supplement, group B takes the supplement
Sample - both groups should contain similar numbers by gender, age, general health, and sleep habits
Hypothesis - the supplement will help people sleep better
Outcome / Key Metric - Self-reported  metric of sleep quality using set scale (perhaps 1-10), anticipating that group B would report improved sleep
Measured Variables - Self-reported metrics of sleep duration and sleepiness during the day
Representative sample randomly split in two with sleep quality collected for a set period before new supplement is randomly introduced to group B.  Metrics of sleep quality, duration and daytime sleepiness.


Will new uniforms help a gym's business?

Hypothesis - new uniforms will improve gym business
Outcome / Key Metric - New memberships use as key metric

Will a new homepage improve my online exotic pet rental business?
Versions - group A directed to current homepage, group B redirected to new homepage

If I put 'please read' in the email subject will more people read my emails?
Versions - group A will be emails sent without 'please read' in the subject, group B will be emails sent with 'please read' int he subject line
Sample - random application of 'please read' to outgoing emails
Hypothesis - percentage of recipients who read emails is greater with 'please read' in the subject
Outcome / Key Metric - are emails read
Measured Variables - what else is in the subject line, what is the content of the email, is it a reply
This is a challenging scenario as knowing if the email was read requires either self-reporting, or a system that alerts the sender when an email is opened.  It also must assume that email that is opened is read, in the latter scenario
