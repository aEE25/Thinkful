For each of the following situations, decide if you would model using a regression or classification model. Discuss your reasoning with your mentor next time you meet.

The amount a person will spend on a given site in the next 24 months.
Regression - The outcome variable is continuous, so regression is appropriate.

What color car someone is going to buy.
Classification - The outcome variable is categorical.

How many children a family will have.
Both methods would work as the outcome variable is numeric, but there are limits to the likely values.  I would choose Regression, to allow for an average value.

If someone will sign up for a service.
Classification - The categorical outcome variable is simply handled

The number of times someone will get sick in a year.
Regression - Although both classification might be an option, the average value is the desired result.

The probability someone will get sick in the next month.
Classification - two options (sick or not sick) for the result variable make it categorical.

Which medicine will work best for a given patient.
Classification - categorial outcome variable
